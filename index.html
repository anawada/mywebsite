        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <p id="desc">Now you know my name. This is a website that I built to show a few of my skills in HTML and CSS. Becoming a Web Developer was a complete career change for me. Honestly, I still have a lot to learn and I'm loving it!!! My ambition? To conquer the famous "Senior" title, be an amazing developer, and build high-level and significant websites that will provide the user with a great experience. Please, have a look around. </p>

        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <p>Something that I think is important for you to know, I love challenges. I came to live in England speaking almost no English at all (bless her!). Was a massive change, 
          as you can imagine. But a few years later here we are, good level of English and lots of different work experiences. Ok, but how is this relevant? Well, I'm resilient and 
          persevering and have always worked as part of a team, something that I really like. I'm not afraid to get out of my comfort zone. I'm a fast learner and really focused. So, 
          the experience that I still don't have I compensate with lots of other really important skills, don't you think? Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my website 
          and for reading all of this!! I appreciate it! You'll find below my contact details and my social media.</p>
